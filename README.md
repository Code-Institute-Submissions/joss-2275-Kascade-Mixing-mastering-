this site is for users in a potentially up an coming band/artist looking 
to record their ideas and have them professionally mixed and mastered.
they may have a look at the previous work the producer has done and a way to contact him.

USER STORIES - 

-as an rock/metal artist i want to find a producer to record my music "home page/portfolio page"

-i want to view all the previous work said producer has done and the artists they have worked with "portfolio page"

-i would like to contact said producer to work with in the future "contact page/footer links to external sites"

-this site would mainly be new visitors as people returning would likely contact the producer directly rather than through the site. HOWEVER, as a returning visitor the main page will always have the latest work/mix displayed for any user to see.



-features: simple NAV bar. footer nav to external sites. responsive on most devices. a few interactive elements, but not much. 
home page with youtube example of produced song, portfolio page with personal statement and link to spotify for all previous work, contact page with form box to contact.

-slight use of bootstrap when doing the main home page split.

-color scheme is revolved around dark/black as it reflects on the type of music. with the pictures all directed around recording/mixing whilst still trying to follow ther dark/black theme.

-Oswald is the main font used throughout the website, as its frequently used and easy to read, i thought it would be good one to use.

-languages used are only HTML5 and CSS3


CANNOT get site to resize properly on certain platforms. index page and portfolio page leaving big white space and cutting half the content.
